# BracketPDA
Simulate a PDA by final state in Python that accepts a string containing balanced brackets of different types. A valid string starts and ends with an exclamation point (!)


The program should simulate the way a PDA would process strings. The PDAâ€™s components (e.g. states, transitions, stack) should be represented through some methods or data structures in Python.
