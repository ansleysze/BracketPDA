# BracketPDA
This Python project implements a Pushdown Automaton (PDA) to validate strings for balanced bracket sequences. The PDA simulates the behavior of a stack machine to check whether the brackets in a given string are properly balanced. Provide input strings when prompted. Make sure the input string starts and ends with an exclamation mark (!) .

The program should simulate the way a PDA would process strings. The PDAâ€™s components (e.g. states, transitions, stack) should be represented through some methods or data structures in Python.
